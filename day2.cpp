I can see you have a file `/d:/Cpp/day2.cpp` with just "boilerplate" as a comment. 

To help you better, could you provide:
1. What you'd like the code to do?
2. What specific changes or additions you need?
3. Any error messages you're encountering?

Feel free to share more details about what you're working on!
